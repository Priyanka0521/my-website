# my-website
In this project I'm using technologies HTML and CSS. It serves as a beginner-friendly project to understand the basic structure of a webpage and how to style it using CSS
The website includes a homepage with a navigation bar,an "About Me" section,and a footer.
It demonstrates how to create a link HTML and CSS files.
Use semantic tags,style text and Layouts, and make the page visually appearing.
